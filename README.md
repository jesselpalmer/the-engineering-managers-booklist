### Tips on Book Selection

The books or subjects aren't in any particular order so feel free to dive into the topics that you want to learn more about. If you are comfortable with your tech skills, I would recommend diving into the soft skills section. If you are more confident in your
soft skills, then I would recommend picking out some books in the tech skills section.
